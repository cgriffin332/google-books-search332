## Description

In this project, I have created a React-based Google Books Search app. It incorporates React components, work with helper/util functions, and React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. It uses Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## Usage

When the user opens the application, they are taken to the search page. The user can then search for the title of their choosing, press "Search" and a list of matches will populate below. The user can view more info about this book by clicking the "View" button. They can click the Save" button to save that book to the database, and the page is reloaded. The user can navigate to their saved books by clicking "Saved" in the navbar.  If the user wishes to remove a book from their saved list, they can press the "Delete" button. Happy reading!
